## General
- Art art art!
- Music
- Fully flush out game design ideas
- ALL very important things! and people who don't code can help!

## Stats singleton
- Should track player stats (i.e. currency, family stats, debt, whatever)
- Not the best method ever but global singleton is quick and easy (good for game jam)
- No need for complexity, just store values to be accessible between scenes

## Daytime / Baking scene
- Art
- Determine controls (should weird mouse movement be a debuff?)
- Determine number of ingredients
- Implement combination of ingredients
    - Biscut manager handles signals from ingredient holders to add ingredient to biscut children

## Nightime / Resource management scene
- Art(?)
- Figure out how we want to handle upgrades
- Honestly figure out what's going here

## LORE
- Mycelium mob gave loan on resturant
- Resturant is everything for our little gnome and his family
- Maybe he finds a grimore along the way that lets him use dark magic on the biscuts
- I need someone else to do lore :3
